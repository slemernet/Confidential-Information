Confidential Information
=======

Extension to safely store sensitive information. Data will be encrypted and only accessible by users with the appropriate credentials. The goal of the module is to protect sensitive information both from unauthorized access from within the company and from anybody who could somehow get a hold of our full database, be them ill-intentioned or simply third parties that require access to support or solve problems.

If you are currently using this module and are looking to upgrade **contact me first**. I will help you migrate your current information. I have not tested applying the new code on existing records so, just in case, let me have a look first.
